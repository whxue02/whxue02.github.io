            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Our generative model synthesizes an animated sequence of a 3D talking face from the spoken audio using diffusion. 
The model extracts audio features from the audio using spectrograms, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and audio encoders (HuBERT). 
Audio features, time embedding, jaw pose, expression, and condition data are then combined to be used as input for the diffusion model’s training. 
The model trains by adding noise to a clip of animation data representing a 3D talking face then attempts to predict the original data by denoising the clip. 
The model is optimized by comparing the predicted frame and the true frame in dataset.
From putting a face on virtual assistants to creating animated instructors to make learning interactive and engaging or protecting anonymity in virtual conferences, the applications of our model are widespread.</p>
